# Introduction

Welcome to Dart Tutorials, this project is designed to host the website www.dart-tutorials.co.uk and is build on top of Rob Eisenberg (aka EisenbergEffect) amazing Framework Durandal.

## Durandal / Grunt / Jasmine / Bootstrap 3

I hear questions raised in all the forums about unit testing Durandal, getting Grunt working and updating to Bootstrap 3. So I decided to create a little project that does all of it. You are free to use this as a skellington app to get you started.

## Build

Clone the repos

npm install the dependences 

run grunt or load up using Visual Studio.
